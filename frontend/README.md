# AdRush Frontend

## Overview
AdRush is a web application that consists of a React frontend and a Node.js backend. This README provides instructions for setting up and running the frontend part of the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` directory containing the optimized production files.

### Folder Structure
- `public/`: Contains the static files, including `index.html`.
- `src/`: Contains the React components, pages, styles, and utility functions.
- `package.json`: Contains the configuration for the frontend, including scripts and dependencies.
